I’m living in Austin, TX, but open to moving elsewhere for the right career opportunities. That being said, Austin is awesome and so are all the friends I've met here.

I'm mostly focused on getting my food recovery app off the ground. I submitted the idea to [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/) and really hope it gets picked up.

Managing a project by myself is hard. I'm using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/invite/link/efe35bb06832423c979e4b28031e82ec) for general team planning and documentation, [Github](https://github.com/currychern/bounti) for the code repository, and [Waffle](https://waffle.io/currychern/bounti) for tickets. I looked into [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) earlier this month, but am now tinkering with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). On top of that, I'm looking to meet others in the Austin Food Recovery Community. I had a great conversation with Lisa from [Keep Austin Fed](http://keepaustinfed.org/) last week.

When taking a break from that, I’m tending to my garden and volunteering at the [Festival Beach Food Forest](https://festivalbeach.org/). Still doing yoga and bouldering at the [Austin Bouldering Project](https://austinboulderingproject.com/), although I've been skipping more yoga days than I like. I have [If You Let Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX8SFlmHTLo) by [Sinéad Harnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_Harnett) stuck in my head.

My days feel packed lately and it's been a bit difficult juggling everything.

## Ways To Help
__Connect__: I'm looking for people in the food recovery space who would be good to talk to. Specifically, I want to know if there is a need for my app and how it might benefit local food recovery efforts. I am also looking for a programming partner who is excited about the idea and in learning together. Feel free to reach out if you're even remotely interested! I'll be needing beta testers as well.

__Volunteer__: We need more [volunteers](https://festivalbeach.org/volunteer/) for site maintenance at the Food Forest. It's an awesome organization, with a mission to make healthy food accessible to all. Let me know if you're interested in helping out!

__Donate__: We're also trying to install an irrigation system at the Food Forest, which will help us substantially with maintaining the site. So any [donations](https://festivalbeach.org/donate/) would be super appreciated!

__Learn__: I have been meaning to learn how to dance, but would feel uncomfortable taking a class alone. Same applies for weight training. So if you're interested in either, but need a buddy let me know.

__Network__: I am not actively looking for a job, but maybe I should be? I'm more interested in getting the food recovery app up and running. And also, job searching is possibly the least enjoyable thing I've ever done. But if you know of any position openings where I might be a good fit, I'd really appreciate it. I am interested in companies that are making an impact in shaping the world (or trying to). I'm looking to expand my skills beyond full stack web development. Machine learning, data science, UI/UX design, and project management all seem interesting to me.

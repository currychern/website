I learned about the [100 Days of Code](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge shortly after moving to Austin, but the task always seemed incredibly daunting. Coding, at least 1 hour each day, for 100 days straight. It feels like an insurmountable task, but I've finally decided to take the plunge, with three amendments to the [rules](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md):

1. I will code at least __30 minutes__ each day, and average __1 hour__ of code each day during the challenge.

2. I will count time spent working on __tutorials__ at a 2:1 discount towards the challenge provided that at least 50 hours of the challenge come from real world coding. So every 2 minutes of tutorial work counts as 1 minute of coding.

3. I will update the __[Log](#log)__ below with the day's progress and provide a link.

### What I'm Hoping For

I'm hoping to hold myself accountable and make reasonable progress towards getting my food recovery app, [Bounti](), released. By Day 100, I hope to be ready to launch a Beta.

In addition, I hope to be able to learn about machine learning and be able to apply these concepts to real world datasets.

By working on real world projects, that need to be robust, I will hopefully develop and reinforce best coding practices including having good tests and documentation within my codebase.

### Log

#### Day 1: Wednesday, June 7, 2017.

__Today's Progress__: Fixed listing and item pages to better reflect the initial mockup. Cleaned up the code a bit as well.

__Thoughts:__ Redoing the components and styling seemed to be a good idea, there were a lot of inefficiencies the first time.

__Link to work:__ [Bounti](https://github.com/currychern/bounti/commit/9b51968cbb54128dcc747cfc6a3a0d3bb3587ae7)

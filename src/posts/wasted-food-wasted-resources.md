Earlier today, I finished my project submission for [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/), an annual Austin civic hackathon. I hope my idea will be chosen as one of 50 projects invited to the fifth annual Hack for Change.

> Bounti is an app that allows neighbors to share surplus food so it won't go to waste. We hope to foster community and help end food waste.

I created a mockup of the app, but before I show it, I wanted to give a bit of background about the problem of wasted food in the United States.

### The Problem

[![Vox - Food Waste](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6RlxySFrkIM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlxySFrkIM)

Americans waste an unbelievable amount of food. According to a 2016 [_Guardian_ report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect), roughly 50 percent of all produce in the United States is thrown away. Produce alone accounts for 60 million tons (or $160 billion) worth of wasted food.

A lot of resources go into creating food: water, land, labor, time. For it to end up in a landfill is a travesty. Within the US, discarded food is the [largest component](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/sustainable-management-food-basics) of landfill and incinerators. This is a huge environmental problem. Wasted food is a rising source of methane, a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

The [2016 Food Sustainability Index](http://foodsustainability.eiu.com/us/) ranked the US third-to-last when it came to food waste (23rd out of 25) with (30-40%) of all food produced in the country going to waste - more than 20 pounds per person per month! This lost food costs about $1,600 a year for a family of four.

This is happening while more than [13% of Americans live in food insecure housefolds](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html). Here in Texas, the rate of food insecurity is even higher - [15.4% of Texas households](https://www.feedingtexas.org/learn/food-insecurity/) experience food insecurity. This is why wasted food is such a big problem. People are still hungry.

It doesn't need to be this way. We aren't just wasting a lot of food. We are wasting a lot of _good_ food. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for a Livable Future released a study that looks at the nutritional value of the food we waste. It turns out the food we waste could feed a [healthy diet to two-thirds](http://newfoodeconomy.com/food-waste-adds-healthy-diet-two-thirds-american-population/) of Americans.

### Bounti

It's for this reason we are starting this project to connect neighbors and allow them to share surplus food. We want our community to be more informed about wasted food and to directly benefit from reducing needless waste. We also hope to partner with local food rescue programs, homeless shelters, food kitchens, and food banks to support access to good food for the food insecure in our community. If you are interested in being involved, please [contact](mailto:curry.chern@gmail.com) us.

Here's a brief view of the mockup for our app as of today. I would appreciate any thoughts, advice, or suggestions! Thanks.

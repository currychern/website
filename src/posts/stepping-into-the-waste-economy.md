Last month, I was working on a startup idea with Edward Sullivan and Dylan Haas. Our idea was to create a service management company where we would help farmers remove manure from their property and divert it to people and facilities that could use manure.

Here's a brief user story sheet that I made describing what we aimed to accomplish:

### The Problem

Manure is a waste product that is an inevitable part of livestock and dairy production. In 2015, a federal judge found that a large industrial dairy in eastern Washington [polluted local drinking water](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jan/15/federal-judge-rules-washington-industrial-dairy-ha/) through its application, storage, and management of manure. This represented the first time that the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, was applied to farm animals.

The manure problem stems from the industrialization of animal feeding operations. In olden times, livestock would be free to roam pastures and their manure would help provide nutrients for the soil. In modern agriculture, we have too much of a good thing. There is too much livestock and simply not enough land to contain all the manure. Some farmers apply manure to their farmland to get rid of the material. When applied to land in excessive amounts, manure from agricultural applications makes its way into the local water system via run off.

Manure is often seen as an unfortunate byproduct of raising livestock. Regulation into manure management is relatively lax compared to other waste products and farmers have no incentive to spend additional money to fix the problem.

### Possible Solutions

Manure __can__ be a value added product. The [American Biogas Council](https://www.americanbiogascouncil.org/) and [EPA AgSTAR](https://www.epa.gov/agstar) both promote anaerobic digestion as a way to sequester methane from manure and create valuable biogas.

Anaerobic digestion is a biological process, similar to composting, whereby manure is placed inside an oxygen-free container where microorganisms break it down and produce gas in the process - mostly methane along with some carbon dioxide. The methane can be used as a biofuel whereas the remaining solids can be separated into fertilizer, organic compost, and mulch.

Manure shares also provide another way for farmers to make money from their manure. Manure shares are a marketplace for livestock and dairy farmers to give their manure to crop farmers and gardeners who will use it as organic fertilizer for their crops.

### Hurdles

There are many hurdles to solving the manure problem. First and foremost, manure is not something that most farmers feel comfortable talking about. It's for a good reason - most people don't know the magnitude of the problem. An dairy farm with 500 cows produces [11,000 tons](http://www.manuremanagement.cornell.edu/Pages/General_Docs/Fact_Sheets/Codigestion_factsheet.pdf) of manure each year, which is enough to fill 400 20' shipping containers!

Furthermore, there is little transparency in the market. Farmers don't have a clear understanding of all the people who would be willing to take manure off their hands and how much transport would cost. Manure removal could actually be a source of income for some farmers, but the opaqueness of the market obscures these opportunities.

Lastly, with the new administration, there seems to be a feeling that environmental regulations won't be as strictly enforced. There is also a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, [H.R. 848](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/848/text), that seeks to exempt manure from being classified as solid waste under the RCRA.

### Our Project

We had some initial interest in our project from a group that represented a large number of dairy farmers in the United States. However, after some consideration, they decided not to work with us. I believe they were afraid of the legal implications of acknowledging the problem with traditional manure management practices. This was quite a disappointment and a substantial set back for us.

We tried to contact individual livestock and dairy farmers who might be interested in participating in our project. We even cold called attendees from a recent manure management conference. We found it very difficult to find farmers who were willing to talk to us, so we decided to pause the project for now.

### Lessons learned

There were a few startup lessons that I learned from this project. I have listed three of them below:

1. __Know Your Customer__ - A business needs to have customers. Unfortunately, we didn't have a detailed plan to finding customers after our Plan A failed. It's best to start a project with a list of potential clients in mind.
2. __Shared Vision & Values__ - Founding a startup is similar to a marriage, it is essential that everyone involved to share a similar vision for the company and hold similar values.
3. __Co-location Premium__ - It is hard enough to start a company, it's even harder to start one remotely where you have to coordinate across timezones.

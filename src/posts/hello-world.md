I was inspired by my friend, [Tony Rice](https://www.austinerudite.com/), to create this blog. Tony recently told me to "show [my] work" and lent me his copy of [_Show Your Work_](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) by [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/). I created this blog to do just that.

To be honest, I am petrified of having my work out in the open, otherwise I would have done this sooner. I think it's the fear of being exposed by putting part of yourself out there. As a perfectionist, nothing I do ever seems good enough to submit to public criticism.

The truth is that I _am_ still learning and I hope this will be true for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, there is a stigma against presenting one's work when one is not an "expert" in the field. This is best evidenced through the pejorative use of _amateur_, which has departed from the original French meaning of the word:

> __am·a·teur__: someone who does something for the love of it, not as a job

In this sense, I am an amateur and will always be for most of the things I do.

I want to share the work I do for four main reasons:

  1. To better track and organize the varied and jumbled thoughts I have.
  2. To hold myself accountable at keeping to my goals.
  3. To show that incremental effort over time can make a big difference.
  4. To share the things I have learned and make it easier for the next person.

I am doubtful that this blog will have a cogent theme as my interests ebb and flow with time. For those that know me, it seems quite likely that this blog will pool into a muddied puddle of stream-of-consciousness. To combat this inevitability, I will make liberal use of tags to try to organize these posts the best I can.

### Building This Blog

To end this post, I wanted to share with you how I made this blog. I was looking for alternatives to Wordpress, which seemed heavy-handed for the blog I was trying to make. I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but wanted a Node.js alternative.

This website was built with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), a Node.js-based static site generator. [Parimal Satyal](https://www.neustadt.fr/parimal-satyal/) has an amazing [Metalsmith tutorial for beginners](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith/) that made this setup a piece of cake. The font I use is [Muli](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli) by [Vernon Adams](http://sansoxygen.com/).
